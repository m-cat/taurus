## About

A WIP roguelike game being developed in Rust. If you see anything that can be improved, please submit an issue.

### Current State

Basic demo is working. You can move around with the arrow keys.

I learned Rust by doing this project but I don't have enough interest in roguelikes to continue development :)

### Todo

* Implement the UI. 
* Messages system.
* Examining tiles with mouse.
* Enemies/AI.
